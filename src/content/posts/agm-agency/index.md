# Prelude

AGM Agency was founded in March 2023 with the goal of helping real estate agents by not only increasing the amount of leads, but also taking weight off their shoulders so they can focus on what they are good at - closing deals.

# Services we provide

## Video marketing

AGM's video marketing is the pinnacle of our strategy - the paragon of our modern marketing. Versatility and effectiveness are two words you can describe our video; it quite literally works in any situation. Give us a property tour, a podcast, educational clip, whatever it may be. I know that you know video brings out the best in your work - so we bring out the best of video.

## Ad campaigns

We run Ad campaigns on all major platforms such as Meta, Google. Ad Campaigns for real estate tends to work a lot better on Meta's platforms: Facebook and Instagram since they allow for more targeted marketing such as sending more adverts of semi-detached houses to people who have families! This results on a higher ROI (Return on Investment) and cheaper CPC (Cost per Click).

## Social media management

This includes posting regularly on your behalf, engaging with your audience building trust and increasing your digital reputation. This is always great for prospect buyers as they are likely to check your activity on your social media before contacting you.

## Website (SEO) + Landing page

A website with good SEO and a landing page as a destination for your CTA's (Call to Action) will not only help you look professional and established, but also help you rank higher on Google!
