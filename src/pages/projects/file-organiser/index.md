# File Organiser

You can check out the project on my
[GitHub](https://github.com/hegde-atri/file-organiser/tree/old)

A C# application written using the Avalonia framework. It was made
when I had recovered over 2TB of data from a hard drive all into one
folder.

This application organizes files in a folder based on specified
options.

I have considered re-writing this appication in rust. I will do so
sometime in the future (TBA).

## The journey

After I had a data loss, I got the idea for this application. I wanted
to write this in C# after enjoying it whilst making my
[NEA](/projects/banking-application). There were quite a few choices
such as .NET MAUI, electron (🤢), Avalonia and the Uno platform.

Ultimately Avalonia was very easy to get started with, and most
importantly worked first try on the linux machines I was using at the
time. The MVC pattern was easy to follow along and I started making
the method that would move the file(`MoveFile(...)`). This took me some
time to develop since I had to take into account many options that I
made available.I learnt how to use file metadata for the first time
Other than a bunch of conditional branching, I also
manipulated string for file path, and handled exception for when
it failed.

## How to use

You can download the application from the [releases page.](https://github.com/hegde-atri/FileOrganizer/releases)

- You select the source and target paths by clicking on the select folder button below their label.
- If you want to sort all files in the source path, leave file type empty. If you want to only sort 1 type of file, then type its extension in the file type box. Example: ".jpg"
- You can organize by the month and year, or only the year of the file taken from the last modified metadata property. If None is selected, the selected file type will just be moved to Target path.
- Scan subfolder: checks for files inside of folders in the source path.
- Auto detect subfolders: creates folders at the target path for every extension it finds.

Then press Organize, you should be able to see the progress in the progress bar and its percentage right above it.

## Disclaimer

- There is not enough validation checks so make sure to test it with small sample to see if it works as intended.
- I do not know how to package MacOS' release files, so it most probably will not work on macOS.
- If moving fails, then your files should be safe. Some will be in the target path, and the rest in the source path (the failed to move files.)
  If this happens, please send me the Exception.txt file created in the target path.
