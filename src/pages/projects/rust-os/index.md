# rust-os

I am building an operating system.

After following the rust tutorial on building a web server. I knew what I wanted to build next.

It was either some sort of telemetry system or an operating system.

I didn't know what telemetry to get, so I went with building an operating system.

Currently following an excellent blog post by Philipp Oppermann ([link](https://os.phil-opp.com/)).

Will update here as my journey progresses.
