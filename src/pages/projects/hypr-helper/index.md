## Versions

There is two versions, the first one was called `hyprland-workspaces`.

After its development and use for about 4-5 months. I decided I could rewrite it better and more efficient. You can find it here [https://github.com/hegde-atri/hyprland-workspaces](https://github.com/hegde-atri/hyprland-workspaces).

Then I rewrote it to listen to a UNIX socket rather polling data. When I started rewriting it, I decided to:
1. Rename it to avoid confusion with another project. It is now called `hypr-helper`
2. Moved the project from GitHub to Codeberg.
