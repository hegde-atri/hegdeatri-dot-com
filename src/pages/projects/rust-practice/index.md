# Rust Practice

A collection of solutions for various interesting problems for learning computer concepts
and algorithms. It also has my solutions for competitive coding sites like Leetcode and
Edabit.

## Calculate pi

### Question

You have a function called random, that calculates a number from 0 to 1 randomly. Now
calculate the value of pi.

### Solution

Pi is the ratio of the circumference to its diameter. Lets imagine the points to be in
a circle now.

We can determine if a point (two of the random numbers we generate) is inside or outside
the circle using the formula $$R = m^{2}$$
